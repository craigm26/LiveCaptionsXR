# PRD: Error Handling & Logging for gemma3n_multimodal Plugin

## Overview
Design and implement robust error handling and logging throughout the plugin to ensure reliability, debuggability, and a good developer experience.

## Goals
- Consistent error reporting from native code to Dart.
- Log key events (model loading, inference, streaming, errors) on both native and Dart sides.
- Provide actionable error messages and codes.

## Requirements
- Map native exceptions/errors to Dart exceptions with clear messages.
- Log model loading time, backend used, and inference duration.
- Expose error and log information to the app for diagnostics.
- Document error codes and log output format.

## Dart API Example
- All public methods throw descriptive exceptions on error.
- Optional: Provide a log stream or callback for advanced usage.

## Milestones
- [ ] Native error mapping and reporting
- [ ] Dart-side error handling and propagation
- [ ] Logging implementation (native and Dart)
- [ ] Documentation of error codes and logs
- [ ] Unit/integration tests
