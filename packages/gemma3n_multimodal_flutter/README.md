# Gemma3n Multimodal Flutter Plugin

This directory contains the Flutter plugin that will wrap the native MediaPipe implementations for Gemma 3n inference.

## Purpose

This plugin provides a Dart API for interacting with the native Gemma 3n inference engine. It abstracts away the platform-specific details of using MediaPipe on Android and iOS, allowing the main Flutter application to work with a single, consistent API.

For more details on the architecture, see the main [ARCHITECTURE.md](../../ARCHITECTURE.md) file in the root directory.
