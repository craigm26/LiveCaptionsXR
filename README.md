# live_captions_xr

**Real-time closed captioning for Android XR headsets powered by on-device multimodal AI.**

---

## 🎯 Purpose

live_captions_xr is a **real-time closed captioning app** for **Android XR headsets** using **on-device multimodal AI** powered by **Google Gemma 3n**. This project targets users who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing (D/HH), providing immersive and spatially-aware captions inside XR environments.

> **live_captions_xr is built by Craig Merry, a developer who is Deaf in one ear and mostly deaf in the other.**
> 
> This lived experience directly inspired the feature set—particularly the need for **accurate sound localization**, **captioning with context**, and **spatial awareness** that is often inaccessible to people with hearing loss.

## 👓 Primary Use Case: Android XR Headsets

- Designed specifically for **Android XR headsets** (e.g. Meta Quest Pro, Lenovo A3).
- Captions appear as **floating, readable overlays** in the user's visual field.
- **Directional indicators** show where the sound originated (left, right, behind).
- Powered entirely by **on-device multimodal AI** using Gemma 3n.

This makes live_captions_xr a pioneering example of **AI-powered accessibility in extended reality**, tuned for real-world D/HH users.

## Gemma 3n Engine

live_captions_xr integrates the **Gemma 3n 4B** `.task` model by running it through a standalone, native inference engine. The model is executed by interpreters written in Kotlin and Swift, with tensor pre-processing and post-processing handled in Dart or native code. This approach relies on our custom Gemma 3n engine and preserves the input and output shapes defined in the model’s metadata.

## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

> **This section is the single source of truth for all features, design, and implementation. All development—by both humans and AI agents—must reference and align with this PRD.**

### Core Captioning Features Powered by Gemma 3n

- **Real-Time Closed Captioning:**
  - Uses Gemma 3n's integrated audio encoder (USM) for state-of-the-art speech recognition.
  - **High-Quality ASR:** On-device transcription of spoken language with contextual understanding.
  - **Multilingual Support:** Recognizes and translates over 140 languages.
  - **Contextual Captions:** Goes beyond basic transcription to provide meaningful context using multimodal AI.
- **Spatial Caption Positioning:**
  - Calculates Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) using XR headset microphone array to estimate sound direction.
  - **Floating XR Overlays:** Captions appear as readable overlays in the user's visual field.
  - **Directional Indicators:** Visual cues (arrows, rings) show where speech/sound originated (left, right, behind).
- **Unified Multimodal Intelligence:**
  - Leverages Gemma 3n's ability to process audio, image, and text inputs simultaneously for enhanced captioning.
  - *Example Workflow:* Detects speech, analyzes XR camera feed, localizes the speaker, and generates contextual captions. Output: "Person at your left said: 'The meeting starts in 5 minutes.'"
- **AI-Enhanced Caption Context:**
  - Uses Gemma 3n's vision encoder to identify speakers and environmental context relevant to conversations.
  - *Example 1:* Detects speech from kitchen area, vision confirms person cooking, outputs: "Person in kitchen: 'Dinner will be ready soon.'"
  - *Example 2:* Identifies multiple speakers in meeting room, provides speaker-specific captions with spatial positioning.
- **XR-Optimized Caption Display:**
  - **Floating Readable Overlays:** Large-text captions positioned optimally in XR space.
  - **Haptic Integration:** XR device vibrations for caption alerts and speaker changes.
  - **Adaptive Visibility:** Captions adjust opacity and positioning based on user's gaze and environment.

### Why Flutter and Gemma 3n for XR Captioning?

- **XR Performance:** Flutter compiles to native ARM code, enabling real-time caption rendering in Android XR environments.
- **Accessible XR UI:** Flutter's widget system supports custom, animated, and highly readable caption overlays for XR displays.
- **XR Hardware Integration:** Flutter plugins provide access to XR headset microphones and cameras; Gemma 3n and Google AI Edge are optimized for mobile XR deployment.
- **Maximum XR Reach:** Single codebase supports multiple Android XR headset platforms, maximizing accessibility impact for the D/HH community.

## Architecture Primer — Cubit-first BLoC

We follow a clean, layered architecture while favouring Cubit over full Blocs to keep code concise. The only time we reach for Bloc is when event-to-state mapping is complex (>1 event ↔ state).
