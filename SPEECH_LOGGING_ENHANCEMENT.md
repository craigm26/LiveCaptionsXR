# Speech Processing Logging Enhancement Summary

## Issue Summary
The user reported that logs weren't clear enough to understand:
1. Whether audio detected was being processed by the model
2. Whether speech recognition was starting to localize sound
3. Whether captions could be placed in AR space

## Root Cause Analysis
The logging had several gaps:
- Audio frames were processed but connection to speech processor wasn't logged clearly
- Voice activity detection was present but not always executed
- Speech recognition results weren't detailed enough
- Caption placement steps weren't visible
- No indication of native plugin communication

## Key Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Audio Processing Logging
**File**: `lib/core/services/stereo_audio_capture.dart`
- Added RMS level calculation for Uint8List audio frames (was missing)
- Added detailed conversion information for debugging
- Now shows both stereo channel levels and mono conversion

### 2. Improved Speech Processor Logging
**File**: `lib/core/services/speech_processor.dart`
- Added clear voice activity threshold comparison logging
- Skip ASR processing when below threshold (saves resources)
- Enhanced native plugin communication tracking
- Added model status and processing status logging
- Improved stream setup and error handling

### 3. Enhanced Caption Placement Logging
**File**: `lib/features/live_captions/cubit/live_captions_cubit.dart`
- Increased logging frequency from every 50th frame to every 10th frame
- Added detailed caption placement step logging
- Enhanced error handling with fallback notification

### 4. Improved Localization Logging
**File**: `lib/core/services/hybrid_localization_engine.dart`
- Added step-by-step localization process logging
- Clear success/failure messages for AR placement
- Enhanced error handling with fallback strategies

### ✅ "Can captions be placed in AR space?"
**Now shows**:
- `🎯 Attempting to place caption in AR space...`
- `📍 Got fused transform for speaker localization`
- `🚀 Invoking native caption placement...`
- `✅ Caption placed successfully in AR space`

## Testing Instructions
1. Enable debug logging in app settings
2. Enter AR mode 
3. Speak some words
4. Check logs for the enhanced output patterns
5. Verify that quiet audio shows "Below voice activity threshold" messages
6. Confirm speech results show confidence scores and processing steps
7. Verify caption placement shows complete localization process

The enhanced logging now provides complete visibility into the speech processing pipeline from audio capture through AR caption placement.
