# AR Session Debug Logging Enhancement Guide

## Problem Addressed
The app was experiencing `PlatformException(NO_SESSION, ARSession not available, null, null)` errors when trying to create AR anchors. Users reported that the AR session used to launch reliably but was failing intermittently.

## Enhanced Debug Logging Added

### Key Logging Points Added

#### 1. AR Session Initialization Flow
**Dart Side (ARSessionCubit.dart)**
- `🔗 Calling showARView via method channel...` - Before native call
- `✅ AR View method channel call completed successfully` - After successful call  
- `❌ AR View method channel call failed` - If call fails
- `🔍 Validating AR session readiness...` - Before validation
- `✅ AR session validation passed` - If validation succeeds
- `⚠️ AR session validation failed, but continuing` - If validation fails

**iOS Side (AppDelegate.swift)**
- `📺 AppDelegate.showARView() called` - Entry point
- `📡 Setting up AR navigation method channel...` - Channel setup
- `📨 AR navigation method call received: showARView` - Method call received
- `🏗️ Creating ARViewController...` - AR view creation
- `🔗 Setting up ARViewController session ready callback...` - Callback setup
- `⏰ Setting up 5-second timeout...` - Timeout setup
- `🚀 Presenting ARViewController...` - Presentation
- `📞 ARViewController.onSessionReady callback triggered` - Success callback
- `⏰ ARSession initialization timed out after 5 seconds` - Timeout

#### 2. ARViewController Session Setup  
**iOS Side (ARViewController.swift)**
- `🏗️ ARViewController.viewDidLoad() called` - View load start
- `✅ ARWorldTrackingConfiguration is supported` - ARKit availability
- `🎮 ARSession created and assigned to sceneView` - Session creation
- `🔗 ARSession assigned to ARAnchorManager.arSession` - Manager assignment
- `📐 Starting ARSession with ARWorldTrackingConfiguration...` - Config start
- `▶️ ARSession.run() called` - Session start
- `🕐 First session readiness check (after 0.5s)...` - First check
- `🕑 Second session readiness check (after 1.0s total)...` - Second check
- `✅ ARSession is ready with current frame` - Success
- `⚠️ ARSession exists but no current frame yet` - Not ready
- `❌ ARAnchorManager.arSession is nil` - Session lost

#### 3. Anchor Placement Debug Logs
**Dart Side (ARSessionCubit.dart)**
- `🔄 Requesting fused transform from hybrid localization...` - Transform request
- `✅ Fused transform retrieved successfully - length: 16` - Transform received
- `🌍 Creating AR anchor at world transform: [1.000, 0.000, 0.000, 0.000...]` - Anchor creation
- `💥 CRITICAL: ARSession not available during anchor placement` - NO_SESSION error
- `⏳ ARSession not ready, will retry` - SESSION_NOT_READY error
- `📝 Invalid arguments passed to anchor creation` - INVALID_ARGUMENTS error

**iOS Side (ARAnchorManager.swift)**
- `🔗 ARAnchorManager.createAnchorAtWorldTransform called` - Method entry
- `📊 Transform array received with 16 elements` - Arguments validated
- `❌ CRITICAL: ARAnchorManager.arSession is nil` - Session missing
- `✅ ARAnchorManager.arSession exists` - Session available
- `❌ ARSession.currentFrame is nil` - No current frame
- `✅ ARSession.currentFrame exists` - Frame available
- `❌ ARSession camera tracking state is not normal` - Tracking issues
- `✅ ARSession camera tracking state is normal` - Tracking OK
- `🎯 Creating ARAnchor with transform...` - Anchor creation
- `✅ ARAnchor created successfully with ID: xyz` - Success

#### 4. Session Health Monitoring
**Dart Side (ARSessionCubit.dart)**
- `🏥 Starting AR session health monitoring...` - Monitoring start
- `🔍 Performing AR session health check...` - Health check
- `✅ AR session health check passed` - Check success
- `⚠️ AR session health check failed` - Check failure
- `💥 CRITICAL: AR session lost during health check` - Session lost
- `🏥 AR session health monitoring stopped` - Monitoring cleanup

### Using the Debug Logs

#### 1. Identify Where the Failure Occurs
Look for the sequence in your logs:

**Normal Successful Flow:**
```
🔗 Calling showARView via method channel...
✅ AR View method channel call completed successfully
📺 AppDelegate.showARView() called
🏗️ Creating ARViewController...
🏗️ ARViewController.viewDidLoad() called
✅ ARWorldTrackingConfiguration is supported
🎮 ARSession created and assigned to sceneView
🔗 ARSession assigned to ARAnchorManager.arSession
📐 Starting ARSession with ARWorldTrackingConfiguration...
▶️ ARSession.run() called
🕐 First session readiness check (after 0.5s)...
✅ ARSession is ready with current frame
📞 ARViewController.onSessionReady callback triggered
✅ Session ready callback: ARAnchorManager.arSession is available
🔍 Validating AR session readiness...
✅ AR session validation passed
🎉 AR session initialized and ready
```

**Look for Where This Breaks:**

#### 2. Common Failure Patterns

**Pattern 1: Method Channel Failure**
```
🔗 Calling showARView via method channel...
❌ AR View method channel call failed
```
*Issue: Communication problem between Dart and native*

**Pattern 2: ARKit Not Supported** 
```
📺 AppDelegate.showARView() called
❌ ARWorldTrackingConfiguration not supported
```
*Issue: Device doesn't support ARKit*

**Pattern 3: Session Creation Failure**
```
🏗️ ARViewController.viewDidLoad() called
✅ ARWorldTrackingConfiguration is supported
🎮 ARSession created and assigned to sceneView
🔗 ARSession assigned to ARAnchorManager.arSession
📐 Starting ARSession with ARWorldTrackingConfiguration...
▶️ ARSession.run() called
🕐 First session readiness check (after 0.5s)...
❌ ARAnchorManager.arSession is nil
```
*Issue: Session assignment failed*

**Pattern 4: Session Not Ready**
```
✅ ARAnchorManager.arSession exists
❌ ARSession.currentFrame is nil
```
*Issue: Session exists but no camera frame yet*

**Pattern 5: Anchor Creation Failure**
```
🌍 Creating AR anchor at world transform: [1.000, 0.000, 0.000, 0.000...]
🔗 ARAnchorManager.createAnchorAtWorldTransform called
❌ CRITICAL: ARAnchorManager.arSession is nil
```
*Issue: Session was lost between initialization and anchor placement*

#### 3. Debugging Steps

1. **Check the complete log sequence** from button press to anchor placement
2. **Identify the last successful log** before the failure
3. **Look for timing issues** - session might not be ready when accessed
4. **Monitor session health** - logs will show if session is lost during operation
5. **Check retry patterns** - anchor placement retries up to 3 times

#### 4. Expected Fixes Based on Findings

- **Method channel issues**: Check Flutter/native integration
- **Timing issues**: Increase delays or improve readiness checking
- **Session loss**: Investigate memory pressure or background app states  
- **ARKit support**: Verify device capabilities and permissions
- **Tracking issues**: Check device movement and lighting conditions

### Additional Debug Commands

You can also trigger manual session validation:
```dart
// In your debug console or test code
await const MethodChannel('live_captions_xr/ar_anchor_methods')
    .invokeMethod('getDeviceOrientation');
```

This will show:
- `✅ Session validation successful, returning device orientation` - Session OK
- `❌ Session validation failed: ARAnchorManager.arSession is nil` - Session missing
- `❌ Session validation failed: no current frame or camera` - Session not ready

### Files Modified

**Dart Files:**
- `lib/features/ar_session/cubit/ar_session_cubit.dart` - Main cubit with validation and health monitoring
- `test/ar_debug_logging_test.dart` - Test suite for debug logging

**iOS Files:**  
- `ios/Runner/ARViewController.swift` - AR view controller with detailed session setup logging
- `ios/Runner/ARAnchorManager.swift` - Anchor manager with comprehensive session validation
- `ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift` - App delegate with AR view launch coordination logging

All changes are minimal and focused on adding logging without modifying core functionality.
