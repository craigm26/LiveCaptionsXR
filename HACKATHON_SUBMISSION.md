# Google Gemma 3n Hackathon Submission: live_captions_xr

**Comprehensive Project Overview for Judges**

---

## 🏆 Project Summary

**live_captions_xr** is an innovative accessibility application that demonstrates the transformative potential of Google's Gemma 3n multimodal AI model for real-world closed captioning in Android XR environments. Our solution addresses critical accessibility challenges for the 466 million people worldwide with hearing loss by creating the first spatially-aware captioning system for extended reality headsets.

**Core Innovation**: Rather than processing speech as isolated audio streams, live_captions_xr leverages Gemma 3n's unified multimodal architecture to understand conversational context holistically, providing spatial captions like "Person at your left said: 'The meeting starts in 5 minutes'" instead of simply displaying flat text transcriptions.

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Deep Dive

### Gemma 3n Integration Strategy

#### Core Service Architecture
```dart
// Comprehensive multimodal processing pipeline
class Gemma3nService {
  Future<String> runMultimodalInference({
    required Float32List audioInput,
    required Float32List imageInput,
    required String textContext,
  }) async {
    // Unified processing through Gemma 3n
    final inputs = _prepareMultimodalInputs(audio, image, text);
    final output = await _interpreter.runForMultipleInputs(inputs, outputMap);
    return _decodeMultimodalResponse(output);
  }
}
```

#### Real-world Integration Example
```dart
// Audio event triggers multimodal analysis
void _processAudioFrame() async {
  final audioFrame = await _captureAudioFrame();
  final audioAnalysis = await _analyzeAudioWithGemma3n(audioFrame);
  
  if (audioAnalysis.confidence > 0.7) {
    final visualContext = await _visualService.captureCurrentFrame();
    final response = await _gemma3nService.runMultimodalInference(
      audioInput: audioFrame,
      imageInput: visualContext,
      textContext: _buildUserContext(audioAnalysis),
    );
    
    // Output: "The microwave to your right has finished heating"
    _deliverAccessibleFeedback(response);
  }
}
```
