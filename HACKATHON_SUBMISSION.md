# Google Gemma 3n Hackathon Submission: live_captions_xr

**Comprehensive Project Overview for Judges**

---

## 🏆 Project Summary

**live_captions_xr** is an innovative accessibility application that demonstrates the transformative potential of Google's Gemma 3n multimodal AI model for real-world closed captioning. Our solution addresses critical accessibility challenges for the 466 million people worldwide with hearing loss by creating a spatially-aware captioning system for both standard mobile devices (iOS/Android) and XR environments.

**Core Innovation**: Rather than processing speech as isolated audio streams, live_captions_xr leverages Gemma 3n's unified multimodal architecture to understand conversational context holistically, providing spatial captions like "Person at your left said: 'The meeting starts in 5 minutes'" instead of simply displaying flat text transcriptions. This is all achieved on-device for maximum privacy and performance.

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Deep Dive

### Gemma 3n Integration Strategy

Our integration strategy is centered on using the official **Google MediaPipe Tasks** library on the native side (Kotlin/Swift) to run the Gemma 3n `.task` model. This approach ensures optimal performance, access to hardware acceleration, and a stable, supported path for on-device inference.

#### Core Service Architecture
```dart
// Dart service layer that communicates with native MediaPipe
class Gemma3nService {
  Future<String> runMultimodalInference({
    required Float32List audioInput,
    required Uint8List imageInput,
    required String textContext,
  }) async {
    // This method will invoke the native MediaPipe implementation
    // via a platform channel, passing the input data.
    final result = await _platformChannel.invokeMethod('runInference', {
      'audio': audioInput,
      'image': imageInput,
      'text': textContext,
    });
    return result;
  }
}
```
