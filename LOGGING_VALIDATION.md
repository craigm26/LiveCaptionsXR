## Enhanced Logging Validation

This document shows the expected log output after the improvements have been implemented.

### Before (Original Issue):
```
[INFO] ✅ Settings loaded successfully
[INFO] 🎤 Starting speech processing...
[INFO] ✅ Speech processing started - waiting for audio chunks...
[INFO] 🎙️ Starting stereo audio capture
[INFO] ✅ Stereo audio capture started successfully
[DEBUG] 📊 Processing Uint8List with 38400 bytes
[DEBUG] 📊 Processing Uint8List with 38400 bytes
[DEBUG] 📊 Processing Uint8List with 38400 bytes
... (no further processing logs)
```

### After (Enhanced Logging):
```
[INFO] ✅ Settings loaded successfully
[INFO] 🎤 Starting speech processing...
[DEBUG] 📡 Speech result stream initialized and listening
[INFO] ✅ Speech processing started - waiting for audio chunks...
[INFO] 🎙️ Starting stereo audio capture

### Key Improvements:

1. **Voice Activity Detection**: Now clearly shows when voice is detected vs. when it's below threshold
2. **Audio Level Monitoring**: Shows RMS levels for both stereo channels and mono processing
3. **Native Plugin Communication**: Tracks when data is sent to and received from the native plugin
4. **Step-by-step Processing**: Shows the complete pipeline from audio → speech → localization → AR placement
5. **Threshold-based Processing**: Skips ASR when audio is below threshold (saves resources)
6. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Better error messages and fallback logging

### Testing the Enhanced Logging:

1. Enable debug logging in app settings
2. Enter AR mode
3. Speak some words
4. Check logs for the enhanced output patterns shown above
5. Verify that low-volume audio shows "Below voice activity threshold" messages
6. Confirm that speech results show confidence scores and final/interim status
7. Verify that caption placement shows the complete localization process

The enhanced logging now provides a clear view of:
- ✅ Whether audio is being processed by the model
- ✅ Voice activity detection results
- ✅ Speech recognition outcomes
- ✅ Localization processing steps
- ✅ Caption placement success/failure
