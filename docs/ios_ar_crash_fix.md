# iOS AR Session Crash Fix

## Problem Description

The app was crashing when ending AR sessions on iOS with the following characteristics:

- **Error Type**: `EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGSEGV)` with `KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS at 0x0000000000000000`
- **Thread**: MediaPipe ThreadPool worker thread (Thread 16)
- **Root Cause**: Null pointer dereference in `std::__1::vector<float, odml::infra::tflite_utils::alignedallocator>::vector`
- **Context**: Part of LLM inference engine (`odml::infra::LlmLiteRTXnnpackExecutor::Create`)

## Root Cause Analysis

The crash was caused by a **race condition** between AR session cleanup and ongoing LLM/MediaPipe inference operations:

1. User taps "Close" button in AR view
2. `ARViewController.closeButtonTapped()` immediately pauses AR session and sets `ARAnchorManager.arSession = nil`
3. Meanwhile, MediaPipe/LLM inference threads are still running in the background
4. These threads attempt to access memory that has been deallocated by the AR cleanup
5. Results in null pointer dereference crash

## Solution Overview

The fix implements **proper cleanup order** and **synchronization** to ensure all background services are stopped before AR resources are deallocated:

### 1. Swift Changes (`ARViewController.swift`)

- **Before**: Immediate AR session cleanup
- **After**: Asynchronous cleanup with completion handler

```swift
// OLD - Immediate cleanup (causes race condition)
sceneView.session.pause()
ARAnchorManager.arSession = nil

// NEW - Wait for Dart services to stop first
arNavigationChannel.invokeMethod("arViewWillClose") { [weak self] result in
    DispatchQueue.main.async {
        self?.performARCleanup() // Only cleanup after services are stopped
    }
}
```

### 2. Dart Changes (`ar_session_cubit.dart`)

- Added **timeouts** to all service stop operations (5s each, 10s total)
- Added **extra delay** (1s) for MediaPipe background threads to complete
- Improved **error handling** to prevent hangs during cleanup

```dart
// Stop services with timeouts
await Future.wait(stopFutures).timeout(
  const Duration(seconds: 10),
  onTimeout: () {
    _logger.w('⏰ Service shutdown timed out, proceeding anyway');
  },
);

// Wait for background threads
await Future.delayed(const Duration(milliseconds: 1000));
```

### 3. Enhanced Service Disposal

All services now have robust disposal with timeout protection:

- `GemmaEnhancer.dispose()` - 5s timeout for model closure
- `EnhancedSpeechProcessor.dispose()` - Timeouts for all stream controllers
- `Gemma3nService.dispose()` - New method with model unloading

## Prevention Strategy

### Cleanup Order

1. **Flutter Services**: Stop all Dart-level services (live captions, speech processing, etc.)
2. **Background Threads**: Wait for MediaPipe/LLM inference threads to complete
3. **Native Resources**: Clean up AR session and native memory

### Timeout Protection

- **Individual Services**: 5s timeout each
- **Total Cleanup**: 10s maximum
- **Background Thread Wait**: 1s additional delay
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continue cleanup even if some services timeout

### Error Handling

- All service stops wrapped in try-catch
- Timeouts prevent indefinite hangs
- Cleanup continues even if individual services fail
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

## Testing

The fix includes a comprehensive test suite (`ar_session_cleanup_test.dart`) that verifies:

- ✅ Normal service cleanup completes successfully
- ✅ Slow services are handled with timeouts
- ✅ Service errors don't prevent overall cleanup
- ✅ Cleanup completes within reasonable time limits

## Migration Notes

### For Developers

If you're adding new services to the AR session:

1. **Always provide a stop function** with timeout protection
2. **Register stop callbacks** in `startAllARServices()`
3. **Implement proper disposal** in service classes
4. **Test timeout scenarios** to ensure robust cleanup

### Example Service Pattern

```dart
class MyService {
  Future<void> dispose() async {
    try {
      await _cleanup().timeout(
        const Duration(seconds: 5),
        onTimeout: () {
          _logger.w('⏰ MyService cleanup timed out');
        },
      );
    } catch (e) {
      _logger.e('❌ Error in MyService cleanup', error: e);
    }
  }
}
```

## Verification

To verify this fix works:

1. Start an AR session with live captions enabled
2. Let it run for a few seconds (to ensure LLM inference is active)
3. Tap the "Close" button
4. Verify the app returns to main screen without crashing
5. Check logs for proper cleanup sequence

The fix ensures that the crash described in issue #84 no longer occurs by eliminating the race condition between service cleanup and AR resource deallocation.
