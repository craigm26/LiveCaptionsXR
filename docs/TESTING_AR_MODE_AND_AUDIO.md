# Step-by-Step Guide: Testing AR Mode & Audio Caption Generation on iOS Simulator

This guide will help you test the AR Mode and audio caption generation features of your app using the iOS Simulator and real devices.

---

## 1. Run the iOS Simulator with ARKit Support

- **Choose a Supported Device:**
  - In Xcode or VS Code, select an iOS Simulator device that supports ARKit (e.g., iPhone 12 Pro or later).
- **Start the Simulator:**
  - In VS Code, use the built-in task:
    - Open the Command Palette (⇧⌘P) and select `Tasks: Run Task` → `Run iOS Simulator`.
    - Or run in terminal: `flutter run -d ios`

---

## 2. Simulate ARKit Features

- **ARKit Simulation in Simulator:**
  - The iOS Simulator can simulate ARKit, but does not use the real camera.
  - Use Xcode’s ARKit simulation tools to:
    - Add virtual objects.
    - Simulate device movement.
    - Test anchor placement and AR overlays.
- **Limitations:**
  - No real-world camera input.
  - Some AR features may be limited or unavailable.

## 3. Test Audio Input & Caption Generation

- **Simulator Limitation:**
  - The iOS Simulator does **not** support microphone input for real-time audio.
- **Workarounds:**
  - Mock or simulate audio input in your code to trigger caption generation logic.
  - You can manually invoke the Flutter MethodChannel (`placeCaption`) from Dart to test AR caption placement.
- **For Full Audio-to-Caption Testing:**
  - Use a real iOS device to test live audio input and caption generation.

---

## 4. Debugging and Logging

- **Use Print Statements:**
  - Your `ARViewController.swift` includes detailed print statements for AR session state and caption placement.
  - Monitor the Xcode or VS Code debug console for logs.
- **Check for Errors:**
  - Watch for any errors or warnings related to ARKit or MethodChannel communication.

---

## 5. Test Flutter MethodChannel Logic

- **Manual Invocation:**
  - From your Dart code, manually call the `placeCaption` method on the `live_captions_xr/caption_methods` channel.
  - Pass a sample transform and text to verify AR caption placement in the simulator.

---

## 6. Test on a Real Device (Recommended for Audio)

- **Connect a Physical iOS Device:**
  - Build and run your app on a real device for full ARKit and audio input support.
- **Test End-to-End Flow:**
  - Speak into the device and verify that captions are generated and placed in AR.

| Feature                        | iOS Simulator | Real Device |
|-------------------------------|:-------------:|:-----------:|
| AR Anchor Placement           |      ✔️       |     ✔️      |
| AR Overlays/Caption Placement |      ✔️       |     ✔️      |
| Real Camera Input             |      ❌       |     ✔️      |
| Microphone Input              |      ❌       |     ✔️      |
| Audio-to-Caption Flow         |   Mock Only   |     ✔️      |

**Tip:** For best results, use the simulator for UI and AR logic, and a real device for audio and full AR experience.
