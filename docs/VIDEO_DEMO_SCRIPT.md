# Video Demo Script & Style

This document provides a recommended outline for creating a short (three-minute) video demonstrating the **Live Captions XR** project. The goal is to tell a clear story about the problem, how the app solves it with Gemma 3n, and the impact on users.

## Script Outline (0–3 minutes)

1. **0:00 – 0:10: Hook & Problem Intro**
   - Show a busy social environment where someone struggles to follow conversation.
   - Narration or on-screen text: *"For the deaf and hard-of-hearing community, following conversations in noisy places is a challenge."*
2. **0:10 – 0:20: Present the Solution**
   - Cut to upbeat visuals of the app in action.
   - Narration: *"Our project uses Google’s Gemma 3n multimodal AI to deliver real‑time, spatially aware captions."*
3. **0:20 – 1:00: How It Works**
   - Display the device’s camera view capturing the scene with captions appearing near the speaker.
   - Emphasize on-device processing, privacy, and low latency.
4. **1:00 – 1:40: User Story**
   - Show a user wearing a headset or holding a phone as captions follow the conversation around them.
   - Include reaction shots highlighting better engagement.
5. **1:40 – 2:20: Unique Features & Technical Highlights**
   - Quick overlays for key points: *“MediaPipe + Gemma 3n,” “On-device audio and visual fusion,” “Low-latency spatial localization.”*
   - Optionally show code snippets or architecture diagrams.
6. **2:20 – 2:50: Impact & Vision**
   - Montage of settings like classrooms, offices, and social gatherings.
   - Narration describing how Live Captions XR improves accessibility in various situations.
7. **2:50 – 3:00: Call to Action**
   - Finish with a strong statement, the app’s logo, and a link or QR code so viewers can learn more or try the demo.

## Style Notes

- Keep clips short with smooth transitions and upbeat music.
- Mix screen recordings of the app with real-life footage for context.
- Use clear, large text overlays that follow accessibility best practices.
- Add subtle animations to show spatial movement (captions from left or right).
- End with a direct URL to the project so judges can view it without logging in.
