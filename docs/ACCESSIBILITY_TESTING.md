# 📋 Accessibility Testing Plan – **Live Captions XR**

## 🧭 Overview
This plan ensures that **Live Captions XR** meets and exceeds accessibility requirements for its target audience—primarily Deaf and Hard of Hearing (D/HH) users—by verifying that:

- All speech and audio information is transformed into **clear, spatial, and actionable captions** (visual overlays, haptic feedback, and directional indicators).
- The app adheres to **WCAG 2.2 AA** principles.
- The 2D and 3D AR captioning interactions are usable, understandable, and safe across diverse physical environments and abilities.

## ✅ Scope
**Tested User Capabilities:**
- Fully Deaf
- Hard of Hearing
- Vision-Impaired + D/HH (low vision, color blindness)
- Cognitive Load Sensitivity (focus, memory, sensory overload)

**Key Features to Test (as defined in the `/prd` directory):**
- Real-time 2D and 3D Caption Overlays (speech transcription + spatial positioning)
- Directional Speaker Indicators
- Haptic Caption Feedback Patterns
- Multi-Speaker Caption Management

## 🧪 Testing Categories

### 1. 🖼️ Visual Accessibility

| Criteria | Description | Method |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Font Readability | All UI text must be legible, scalable via system settings. | Test on Android/iOS accessibility font sizes. |
| Color Contrast | Must meet WCAG 2.2 AA for text/background (4.5:1 minimum). | Use tools like Accessibility Scanner or Color Contrast Analyzer. |
| Directional Overlays | Arrows, rings, and bounding boxes must be distinguishable. | Test in colorblind mode & various lighting conditions. |
| Motion Reduction | Users should be able to reduce animations. | Honor system "Reduce Motion" settings. |

### 2. 📳 Haptic Feedback

| Criteria | Description | Method |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| Pattern Consistency | Haptics must feel distinct for different events. | Physical testing with diverse devices. |
| Optionality | Must be toggled via Settings. | Confirm toggle applies immediately and persists. |

### 3. 🚨 Emergency Scenarios

| Criteria | Description | Method |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| Critical Alert Priority | Fire alarms, sirens must override all other notifications. | Simulate emergency scenarios. |
| Fallback Mechanisms | If one feedback channel fails, others must compensate. | Test with haptics disabled, etc. |
| Response Time | Critical alerts must appear within 2 seconds. | Performance testing under load. |

## 🔬 Testing Methodology

### Phase 1: Automated Testing
- **Accessibility Scanner (Android)** & **Xcode Accessibility Inspector (iOS)** - Check for basic WCAG violations.
- **VoiceOver/TalkBack Compatibility** - Ensure screen reader compatibility.
- **Color Contrast Analysis** - Verify all text meets WCAG AA standards.

### Phase 2: Manual Testing
- **Device Variety** - Test on different screen sizes and OS versions.
- **Environmental Testing** - Test in noisy, quiet, bright, and dark environments.
- **Stress Testing** - Test with multiple simultaneous alerts and overlays.

### Phase 3: User Testing
- **D/HH Community Feedback** - Partner with local D/HH organizations for real-world testing.
- **A/B Testing** - Compare different visual designs and feedback patterns.
- **Long-term Usage** - Monitor usage patterns and user preferences over time.

## 📊 Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement Method |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| WCAG 2.2 AA Compliance | 100% | Automated scanning + manual review. |
| User Task Completion Rate | >95% | User testing sessions. |
| Alert Recognition Accuracy | >90% | Controlled testing scenarios. |
| User Satisfaction Score | >4.5/5 | Post-testing surveys. |

This testing plan ensures `Live Captions XR` delivers on its promise to provide reliable and accessible captioning for the D/HH community.

## AR Caption Placement
- Captions are now spatially anchored in AR at the estimated 3D position of the speaker using hybrid localization (audio, vision, IMU fusion).
- Test that captions appear at the correct location in AR and follow the speaker as they move.
- Use the AR navigation and caption placement MethodChannels to trigger and verify AR captioning from Flutter.

## MethodChannels
- `Live Captions XR/ar_navigation`: Launch native AR view.
- `Live Captions XR/caption_methods`: Place captions in AR.

## Other Accessibility Features
- Real-time, privacy-preserving speech transcription.
- Visual and audio event overlays.
- Modular, extensible architecture for new accessibility features.
