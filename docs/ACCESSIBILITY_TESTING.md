# 📋 Accessibility Testing Plan – **live_captions_xr**

## 🧭 Overview
This plan ensures that **live_captions_xr** meets and exceeds accessibility requirements for its target audience—primarily Deaf and Hard of Hearing (D/HH) users in Android XR environments—by verifying that:

- All speech and audio information is transformed into **clear, spatial, and actionable captions** (visual overlays, haptic, directional indicators).
- The app adheres to **WCAG 2.2 AA** principles where applicable for XR environments.
- XR caption interactions remain usable, understandable, and safe across diverse physical environments and abilities.

## ✅ Scope
**Tested User Capabilities:**
- Fully Deaf
- Hard of Hearing
- Vision-Impaired + D/HH (low vision, color blindness)
- Cognitive Load Sensitivity (focus, memory, sensory overload in XR)

**Key XR Captioning Features to Test:**
- Real-time XR Caption Overlays (speech transcription + spatial positioning)
- Directional Speaker Indicators
- Haptic Caption Feedback Patterns
- Multi-Speaker Caption Management
- Caption History and Settings in XR
- XR Onboarding UX

| Setting Persistence | All accessibility preferences must persist across app restarts | Automated testing |
| Quick Toggles | Emergency or frequent settings should be easily accessible | Test one-handed operation |
| Clear Documentation | In-app help should explain each accessibility feature | Review help text with D/HH users |

### 6. 🚨 Emergency Scenarios

| Criteria | Description | Method |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| Critical Alert Priority | Fire alarms, sirens must override all other notifications | Simulate emergency scenarios |
| Fallback Mechanisms | If one feedback channel fails, others must compensate | Test with haptics disabled, LED broken, etc. |
| Response Time | Critical alerts must appear within 2 seconds | Performance testing under load |

## 🔬 Testing Methodology

### Phase 1: Automated Testing
- **Accessibility Scanner (Android)** - Check for basic WCAG violations
- **VoiceOver/TalkBack Compatibility** - Ensure screen reader compatibility
- **Color Contrast Analysis** - Verify all text meets WCAG AA standards
- **Performance Testing** - Ensure accessibility features don't impact app performance

### Phase 2: Manual Testing
- **Device Variety** - Test on different screen sizes, Android versions, and device capabilities
- **Environmental Testing** - Test in noisy, quiet, bright, and dark environments
- **Stress Testing** - Test with multiple simultaneous alerts and overlays

### Phase 3: User Testing
- **D/HH Community Feedback** - Partner with local D/HH organizations for real-world testing
- **A/B Testing** - Compare different visual designs and feedback patterns
- **Long-term Usage** - Monitor usage patterns and user preferences over time

## 📊 Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement Method |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| WCAG 2.2 AA Compliance | 100% | Automated scanning + manual review |
| User Task Completion Rate | >95% | User testing sessions |
| Alert Recognition Accuracy | >90% | Controlled testing scenarios |
| User Satisfaction Score | >4.5/5 | Post-testing surveys |
| Time to Critical Alert Recognition | <2 seconds | Performance monitoring |
