# Speech Processing Debug Guide

## Quick Debugging Steps

### 1. Check Audio Capture
Look for these logs after entering AR mode:
```
[INFO] ðŸŽ§ Starting stereo audio capture
[INFO] âœ… Stereo audio capture started successfully
[DEBUG] ðŸ“Š Audio frame #50: 1024 samples, RMS: 0.0156
```

**If missing:** Audio permissions or hardware issue

### 2. Check Speech Processor Connection
Look for these logs:
```
[INFO] ðŸŽ¤ Starting speech processing...
[DEBUG] ðŸ“Š Processing audio chunk: 512 samples
[DEBUG] ðŸ”Š Audio RMS level: 0.0156 (threshold: 0.01)
```

**If missing:** Audio not reaching speech processor

### 3. Check Voice Activity Detection
Look for:
```
[DEBUG] ðŸŽ¯ Voice activity detected, sending to ASR...
```

**If seeing:** `ðŸ”‡ Below voice activity threshold, skipping ASR`
**Solution:** Speak louder or adjust threshold

### 4. Check Speech Recognition Results
Look for:
```
[INFO] ðŸ“¥ Received stream data: speechResult
[INFO] ðŸŽ¤ Speech result received: "Hello world"
```

**If missing:** Native plugin or model issue

### 5. Check AR Caption Placement
Look for:
```
[INFO] ðŸŽ¯ Attempting to place caption in AR space...
[INFO] âœ… Caption placed successfully in AR space
```

**If missing:** AR session or localization issue

## Log Level Configuration

Enable debug logging in your app settings:
1. Go to Settings â†’ Developer & Testing
2. Enable "Debug Logging Overlay"
3. Set log level to "Debug" or "Verbose"

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: No audio frames captured
**Symptoms:** No "ðŸ“Š Audio frame" logs
**Solution:** Check microphone permissions

### Issue: Audio captured but no speech processing
**Symptoms:** "ðŸ“Š Audio frame" logs but no "ðŸŽ¤ Processing audio chunk"
**Solution:** Check if LiveCaptionsCubit properly connects audio to speech processor

### Issue: Speech processing but no recognition results
**Symptoms:** "ðŸŽ¤ Processing audio chunk" but no "ðŸ“¥ Received stream data"
**Solution:** Check Gemma 3n model loading and native plugin

### Issue: Recognition results but no AR captions
**Symptoms:** "ðŸŽ¤ Speech result received" but no "ðŸŽ¯ Attempting to place caption"
**Solution:** Check AR session state and hybrid localization engine

## Testing Commands

Run the speech flow test:
```bash
dart test_speech_flow.dart
```

Check debug logs in real-time:
```bash
# If using iOS Simulator
xcrun simctl spawn booted log stream --predicate 'subsystem == "com.example.livecaptions"'
```
