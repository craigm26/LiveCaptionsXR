# üö® iOS Build Status & Developer Alert

## Current Status: ‚úÖ BUILDS SUCCESSFULLY

The iOS build has been fixed and is now working. However, **several features are temporarily disabled** and need to be restored.

## üîß What Was Fixed
- MediaPipe plugin compilation errors
- iOS deployment target updated to 14.0
- Pod configuration for MediaPipe frameworks
- Dependency resolution issues

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What's Temporarily Disabled

### In `ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift`:
- `VisualSpeakerIdentifier` - Face detection and speaker ID
- `ARAnchorManager` - ARKit anchor management  
- `HybridLocalizationEngine` - Audio-visual fusion
- `StereoAudioCapturePlugin` - Stereo audio capture
- `SpeechLocalizerPlugin` - Speech localization

### In `plugins/gemma3n_multimodal/ios/Classes/Gemma3nMultimodalPlugin.swift`:
- Full MediaPipe LLM Inference integration
- Streaming API capabilities
- Advanced multimodal features

## üéØ Next Steps for Developers

### **IMPORTANT**: Before uncommenting any features:
1. **Read the full PRD**: `prd/17_ios_build_fixes_and_feature_restoration.md`
2. **Ensure Xcode setup**: Make sure all Swift files are added to the Xcode project
3. **Test incrementally**: Uncomment one feature at a time
4. **Add tests**: Each restored feature needs unit tests

### Quick Start for Feature Restoration:
```bash
# Always test the build after changes
flutter clean && flutter pub get
cd ios && pod install  
flutter build ios
```

### Restoration Order (Recommended):
1. `ARAnchorManager` (Core AR functionality)
2. `HybridLocalizationEngine` (Sensor fusion)
3. `StereoAudioCapturePlugin` (Audio processing)
4. `SpeechLocalizerPlugin` (Speech detection)
5. `VisualSpeakerIdentifier` (Computer vision)
6. MediaPipe integration (AI inference)

## üìö Documentation
- **Full PRD**: `prd/17_ios_build_fixes_and_feature_restoration.md`
- **Architecture**: `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- **Technical Details**: `TECHNICAL_WRITEUP.md`

## üî• Critical Notes
- **iOS 14.0+ Required**: Don't change the deployment target
- **Test on Device**: Simulator may not support all features
- **Memory Management**: These are heavy frameworks - watch performance
- **Gradual Approach**: Don't uncomment everything at once
