# ðŸš¨ iOS Build Status & Developer Alert

## Current Status: âœ… ALL FEATURES RESTORED

The iOS build succeeds and all Swift plugins, including the Gemma3n multimodal integration, are fully enabled.

## ðŸ”§ What Was Fixed
- MediaPipe plugin compilation errors
- iOS deployment target updated to 14.0
- Pod configuration for MediaPipe frameworks
- Dependency resolution issues


## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps for Developers

### Development Tips
1. **Read the full PRD**: `prd/17_ios_build_fixes_and_feature_restoration.md`
2. **Ensure Xcode setup**: Make sure all Swift files are added to the Xcode project
3. **Add tests**: Each restored feature needs unit tests

### Quick Start for Feature Restoration:
```bash
# Always test the build after changes
flutter clean && flutter pub get
cd ios && pod install  
flutter build ios
```

### Restoration Order (Recommended):
1. `ARAnchorManager` (Core AR functionality)
2. `HybridLocalizationEngine` (Sensor fusion)
3. `StereoAudioCapturePlugin` (Audio processing)
4. `SpeechLocalizerPlugin` (Speech detection)
5. `VisualSpeakerIdentifier` (Computer vision)
6. MediaPipe integration (AI inference)

## ðŸ”¥ Critical Notes
- **iOS 14.0+ Required**: Don't change the deployment target
- **Test on Device**: Simulator may not support all features
- **Memory Management**: These are heavy frameworks - watch performance
- **Gradual Approach**: Don't uncomment everything at once
