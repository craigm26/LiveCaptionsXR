# Audio Capture Plugin Crash Fix Verification Script
# This script helps verify that the StereoAudioCapturePlugin crash fix is working

echo "üé§ Audio Capture Plugin Crash Fix - Verification Guide"
echo "=================================================="
echo ""

echo "üì± The Problem (Before Fix):"
echo "When entering AR mode, the app would crash with:"
echo "  AVAudioIONodeImpl::SetOutputFormat exception"
echo "  Exception at StereoAudioCapturePlugin.swift:63"
echo "  installTap(onBus:bufferSize:format:) throwing SIGABRT"
echo "  This happened because the plugin forced stereo format without validation"
echo ""

echo "‚úÖ The Solution (After Fix):"
echo "1. Use input node's native format instead of forcing stereo"
echo "2. Gracefully fall back to mono if stereo is unavailable"
echo "3. Remove existing taps before installing new ones"
echo "4. Add proper error handling for format mismatches"
echo "5. Make audio session configuration more robust"
echo ""

echo "üîß Key Changes Made:"
echo "- Line 64: Added input.removeTap(onBus: 0) to clear existing taps"
echo "- Line 67: Use inputFormat = input.inputFormat(forBus: 0) instead of hardcoded format"
echo "- Line 71: channelCount = min(inputFormat.channelCount, 2) for fallback"
echo "- Line 72-80: Proper format validation with error handling"
echo "- Line 139-169: Enhanced handleAudioBuffer to support both mono and stereo"
echo "- Line 115-137: More robust configureSession with non-fatal warnings"
echo ""

echo "üß™ How to Test the Fix:"
echo "1. Build the app for a physical iOS device"
echo "2. Grant camera and microphone permissions"
echo "3. Launch the app and tap 'Enter AR Mode'"
echo "4. The app should NOT crash - it should enter AR mode successfully"
echo "5. Check device logs for any audio-related warnings (not errors)"
echo ""

echo "üìä Expected Behavior:"
echo "‚úÖ No crash when entering AR mode"
echo "‚úÖ Audio capture works with both mono and stereo devices"
echo "‚úÖ Proper error messages if audio setup fails"
echo "‚úÖ Warning messages for non-critical audio preference failures"
echo ""

echo "üêõ What This Fix Addresses:"
echo "‚úÖ SIGABRT crash in AVAudioEngine.installTap"
echo "‚úÖ Format mismatch between requested and supported formats"
echo "‚úÖ Lack of existing tap cleanup before new installation"
echo "‚úÖ Brittle audio session configuration"
echo "‚úÖ Missing error handling for unsupported audio formats"
echo ""

echo "üîç Test Cases Covered:"
echo "1. Device with stereo microphone support"
echo "2. Device with mono microphone only"
echo "3. Device with unsupported audio formats"
echo "4. Multiple start/stop recording cycles"
echo "5. Audio permission denied scenarios"
echo ""

echo "üìù Code Review Checklist:"
echo "‚ñ° Input format is queried from device, not hardcoded"
echo "‚ñ° Channel count is validated and clamped to max 2"
echo "‚ñ° Format creation is wrapped in guard statement"
echo "‚ñ° Existing taps are removed before new installation"
echo "‚ñ° Audio session preferences are non-fatal"
echo "‚ñ° Buffer handling supports both mono and stereo"
echo "‚ñ° Error codes are descriptive and actionable"
echo ""

echo "‚úÖ Fix Status: IMPLEMENTED"
echo "This fix should resolve the AR mode crash reported in issue #65"
