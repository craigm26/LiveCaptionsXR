echo "🧪 AR Mode Navigation Fix - Manual Verification Guide"
echo "=================================================="

echo "📱 Testing Environment Setup:"
echo "- Use a physical iOS device with ARKit support (iPhone 7 or newer)"
echo "- Ensure camera permissions are granted"
echo "- Build and run the app in debug mode for better logging"
echo ""

echo "🔬 Test Case 1: Successful AR Mode Entry"
echo "Expected Behavior:"
echo "1. User taps 'Enter AR Mode' floating action button (🥽)"
echo "2. Loading indicator appears: '🥽 Entering AR Mode...' (blue snackbar)"
echo "3. AR view launches in fullscreen (camera view with AR scene)"
echo "4. Loading indicator disappears after 3 seconds"
echo "5. User sees AR interface with close button in top-right"
echo "6. Speech processing starts - speak to see caption bubbles in AR space"
echo "7. No 'NO_SESSION' errors in debug logs"
echo ""

echo "🔬 Test Case 2: Error Handling"
echo "Test on simulator or unsupported device:"
echo "1. User taps 'Enter AR Mode' button"
echo "2. Loading indicator appears briefly"
echo "3. Error message appears: '❌ Failed to enter AR mode: ARKit not supported'"
echo "4. User remains on home screen"
echo "5. Button remains functional for retry"
echo ""

echo "🔍 Debug Log Verification:"
echo "Look for these log entries in sequence:"
echo ""
echo "✅ Expected Success Flow:"
echo "[INFO] 🥽 Enter AR Mode button pressed..."
echo "[INFO] 🥽 Initializing AR session..."
echo "[INFO] 🔗 Calling showARView via method channel..."
echo "[INFO] ✅ AR View method channel call completed successfully"
echo "[INFO] ✅ AR View launched successfully"
echo "[INFO] ⏳ Waiting for ARSession to fully initialize..."
echo "[INFO] 🔍 Validating AR session readiness..."
echo "[INFO] ✅ AR session validation passed"
echo "[INFO] 🎉 AR session initialized and ready"
echo "[INFO] ⏳ Waiting for AR view to be fully presented..."
echo "[INFO] 🚀 Starting all services for AR mode..."
echo "[INFO] ⏳ Waiting for services to fully initialize before anchor placement..."
echo "[INFO] 🎯 Auto-placing AR anchor... (attempt 1/3)"
echo "[INFO] ✅ Fused transform retrieved successfully"
echo "[INFO] 🌍 Creating AR anchor at world transform: [1.000, 0.000, 0.000, 0.000...]"
echo "[INFO] 🎉 AR anchor auto-placed successfully: [anchor-id]"
echo "[INFO] 🎉 All AR mode services started successfully"
echo "[INFO] 🎉 Successfully entered AR mode with all services"
echo ""

echo "❌ Error Indicators to Watch For:"
echo "- NO 'NO_SESSION' errors during anchor creation"
echo "- NO immediate service startup (should wait 1.5s)"
echo "- NO anchor placement before services are ready"
echo ""

echo "🎯 User Experience Validation:"
echo "1. Smooth transition from home screen to AR view"
echo "2. Clear loading feedback during transition"
echo "3. AR view appears in fullscreen mode"
echo "4. Caption bubbles appear in 3D space when speaking"
echo "5. Directional audio indicators work in AR space"
echo "6. Close button allows return to home screen"
echo ""

echo "📊 Performance Metrics:"
echo "- AR mode entry should complete within 5 seconds"
echo "- Loading indicator should be visible for 1-3 seconds"
echo "- No frame drops during AR view presentation"
echo "- Memory usage remains stable in AR mode"
echo ""

echo "🐛 Common Issues Fixed:"
echo "✅ Users staying on home screen instead of entering AR view"
echo "✅ 'NO_SESSION' errors during anchor placement"
echo "✅ Services starting before AR session is ready"
echo "✅ Missing user feedback during AR mode transition"
echo "✅ Race conditions between AR initialization and service startup"

echo "📝 Manual Test Checklist:"
echo "□ Tap Enter AR Mode button"
echo "□ Verify loading indicator appears"
echo "□ Confirm AR view launches in fullscreen"
echo "□ Check debug logs for success sequence"
echo "□ Speak to test caption bubbles in AR"
echo "□ Test close button to return to home"
echo "□ Retry AR mode entry multiple times"
echo "□ Test on both supported and unsupported devices"
