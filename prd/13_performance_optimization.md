## 1. Overview & Background

*   **What is this feature?**
    *   This is an ongoing, cross-cutting task focused on profiling, optimizing, and managing the computational resources (CPU, GPU, memory, battery) used by the LiveCaptionsXR application. It involves ensuring that all the complex, real-time processing (ASR, AR, CV) can run smoothly and efficiently on a mobile device.
*   **Why are we building this?**
    *   The application combines several resource-intensive technologies. Without deliberate optimization, the app could suffer from poor performance (low frame rates), excessive battery drain, or overheating, leading to a poor user experience and making the app impractical for sustained use. This task ensures the app is not just functional, but also efficient and usable in the real world.
*   **Business Objectives & Key Results (OKRs):**
    *   **Objective:** Ensure the application is performant, stable, and efficient for a high-quality user experience.
        *   **Key Result 1:** The app maintains a stable 30+ FPS in AR mode during a continuous 15-minute session.
        *   **Key Result 2:** The app consumes less than 20% of the device's battery per hour of continuous use.
        *   **Key Result 3:** The memory usage of the app remains stable and below the system-imposed limits, with no memory leaks detected.

## 2. Target Audience & User Personas

*   **Who is this for?**
    *   This is a non-user-facing technical task. However, all users will benefit from a smooth, responsive app that doesn't quickly drain their battery or heat up their phone.

## 3. User Stories & Requirements

| Priority | User Story                                                                                             | Acceptance Criteria                                                                                                                                                              |
| :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **P0**   | As a user, I want the app to run smoothly without stuttering or freezing, especially in AR mode.         | - The main thread is never blocked by heavy computation. <br> - All intensive processing (ASR, CV, etc.) is offloaded to background threads. <br> - The AR rendering loop consistently meets its frame rate target. |
| **P0**   | As a user, I want to be able to use the app for a reasonable amount of time without my phone getting hot or the battery dying quickly. | - The CPU and GPU usage are profiled and optimized. <br> - Unnecessary computations are eliminated. <br> - The app correctly releases resources (e.g., stops the camera and ASR model) when it is sent to the background. |
| **P0**   | As a user, I want the app to be stable and not crash.                                                    | - Memory usage is profiled using Instruments to identify and fix any leaks. <br> - The Gemma 3n model and other large resources are loaded into memory once and managed carefully. |

## 4. Scope & Features

*   **In-Scope Features (Must-Haves):**
    *   Regular profiling of the app using Xcode's Instruments (Time Profiler, Leaks, Energy Log).
    *   Optimization of CPU-intensive code (e.g., signal processing, filter calculations).
    *   Optimization of GPU-intensive code (e.g., AR rendering).
    *   Careful management of the lifecycle of resource-heavy objects like the Gemma 3n model, ARSession, and AVAudioEngine.
    *   Ensuring all processing is done on the appropriate background threads or GCD queues.
*   **Out-of-Scope Features (Won't Be Included in this Version):**
    *   Creating a user-facing "low power" mode (though optimizations may naturally lead to lower power consumption).

## 5. Design & User Experience (UX)

*   This is a purely technical task and has no direct UI/UX design, but its success is a prerequisite for a good user experience.

---

## 6. Technical Requirements & Constraints

*   **Platform(s):** iOS
*   **Technology Stack:** Swift, Instruments, GCD, ARKit, AVFoundation.
*   **Performance Requirements:**
    *   The entire task is defined by performance requirements. See OKRs for specific targets.

## 7. Analytics & Success Metrics

*   **How will we measure success?**
    *   Success will be measured through rigorous profiling and benchmarking on target devices.
*   **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
    *   **Frames Per Second (FPS):** Measured in AR mode.
    *   **CPU/GPU Utilization (%):** Measured with Instruments.
    *   **Energy Impact (mWh):** Measured with Instruments.
    *   **Memory Footprint (MB):** Measured with Instruments.
    *   **Number of Memory Leaks:** Should be zero.

## 8. Go-to-Market & Launch Plan

*   While not a feature to be marketed directly, the resulting performance and efficiency can be mentioned in app descriptions (e.g., "Optimized for all-day use").

---

## 9. Open Questions & Assumptions

*   **Open Questions:**
    *   Where are the primary performance bottlenecks in the application? This will be the first question to answer through profiling.
*   **Assumptions:**
    *   We assume that with careful optimization, it is possible to run all the required real-time processes on a target iOS device without exceeding its thermal and power budget.
