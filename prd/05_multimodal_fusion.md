**Status:** Draft
**Version:** 1.0

## 1. Overview & Background

*   **What is this feature?**
    *   This feature leverages the multimodal capabilities of the Gemma 3n model by allowing it to process a visual input (a camera frame) in conjunction with the audio stream. The model will use the visual context to improve the accuracy and contextual relevance of the speech transcription.
*   **Why are we building this?**
    *   In many real-world scenarios, visual context can help disambiguate speech. For example, seeing a "saw" (the tool) can help the model correctly transcribe the word "saw" instead of "see". This feature will make the captions more intelligent and accurate, especially in noisy or ambiguous environments. This is a key differentiator for the LiveCaptionsXR app.
*   **Business Objectives & Key Results (OKRs):**
    *   **Objective:** Improve ASR accuracy and contextual understanding by incorporating visual information.
        *   **Key Result 1:** Reduce the Word Error Rate (WER) by at least 10% (relative) on a custom dataset of visually ambiguous sentences compared to the audio-only ASR.
        *   **Key Result 2:** The system correctly uses visual context to resolve at least 75% of tested homophones or context-dependent phrases.
        *   **Key Result 3:** The addition of visual processing does not increase the overall captioning latency by more than 100ms.

## 2. Target Audience & User Personas

*   **Who is this for?**
    *   This feature is for the end-users of the LiveCaptionsXR app, who will experience more accurate and context-aware captions. It is also for the developers who will integrate this advanced capability.

## 3. User Stories & Requirements

| Priority | User Story                                                                                             | Acceptance Criteria                                                                                                                                                              |
| :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **P0**   | As a user, I want the captions to be smarter and understand what I'm looking at, so that the transcription is more accurate. | - The app can capture a camera frame and provide it to the ASR model. <br> - The transcription results are demonstrably better when relevant visual context is available. |
| **P0**   | As a developer, I want to provide an image along with an audio stream to the Gemma 3n model.             | - The ASR API is extended to accept an optional image input (e.g., as a `Uint8List` or similar format). <br> - The underlying native code correctly feeds both the audio and image data to the MediaPipe/Google AI Edge session. |

## 4. Scope & Features

*   **In-Scope Features (Must-Haves):**
    *   An API to provide an image (e.g., a camera frame) to the Gemma 3n inference session.
    *   Management of the multimodal (audio + visual) inference session.
    *   Conversion of the image from a Flutter-friendly format to the format required by the native MediaPipe API.
*   **Out-of-Scope Features (Won't Be Included in this Version):**
    *   Continuous video stream processing (the initial version will work with single image frames as context).
    *   Object detection or other advanced computer vision tasks (we rely on Gemma 3n's internal vision encoder).

---

## 5. Design & User Experience (UX)

*   **API Design:**
    *   The `GemmaASR` class will be updated. The `startStream()` method will be overloaded or updated to accept an optional `visionContext` parameter, e.g., `startStream({Uint8List? visionContext})`.
    *   A method like `setVisionContext(Uint8List image)` will allow updating the visual context during a session.

## 6. Technical Requirements & Constraints

*   **Platform(s):** Android, iOS
*   **Technology Stack:** Flutter, Dart, Kotlin, Swift, MediaPipe/Google AI Edge.
*   **Performance Requirements:**
    *   The image processing and fusion should add no more than 100ms to the total latency.
    *   Memory usage must be carefully managed, as holding both the Gemma 3n model and an image in memory can be intensive.
*   **Model:**
    *   A multimodal variant of the Gemma 3n `.task` model must be used.

## 7. Analytics & Success Metrics

*   **How will we measure success?**
    *   Success will be measured by the improvement in transcription accuracy when visual context is provided.
*   **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
    *   **WER Reduction:** The relative percentage decrease in Word Error Rate on a curated test set.
    *   **Contextual Accuracy Score:** A manually graded score based on how well the model uses visual cues to produce contextually correct transcriptions.
    *   **Latency Impact:** The measured increase in latency when the visual modality is enabled.

## 8. Go-to-Market & Launch Plan

*   This advanced feature will be a major highlight in the app's marketing, showcasing its "smart" captioning capabilities.

---

## 9. Open Questions & Assumptions

*   **Open Questions:**
    *   How frequently should the visual context be updated for the best results without impacting performance?
*   **Assumptions:**
    *   We assume that the MediaPipe/Google AI Edge API provides a straightforward way to conduct simultaneous audio and visual inference with Gemma 3n.
    *   We assume the performance overhead of the vision encoder is acceptable for a real-time mobile application.
