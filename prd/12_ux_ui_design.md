## 1. Overview & Background

*   **What is this feature?**
    *   This encompasses the complete user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) design for the LiveCaptionsXR application. It covers everything from the initial onboarding to the in-app controls for switching modes, as well as the visual design of the 2D and 3D captions themselves.
*   **Why are we building this?**
    *   Powerful technology is only useful if it's presented through a clear, intuitive, and aesthetically pleasing interface. A strong UX/UI design will make the app a pleasure to use, encourage adoption, and ensure the accessibility goals of the project are met. It defines the "look and feel" of the entire application.
*   **Business Objectives & Key Results (OKRs):**
    *   **Objective:** Create an intuitive, engaging, and visually polished user experience.
        *   **Key Result 1:** New users can successfully start using the app's core captioning feature within 30 seconds of first launch.
        *   **Key Result 2:** The app achieves a user satisfaction score of 4.5/5 or higher in app store ratings.
        *   **Key Result 3:** The final UI is compliant with WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards.

## 2. Target Audience & User Personas

*   **Who is this for?**
    *   This is for all end-users of the LiveCaptionsXR app. The design must be inclusive, catering to both tech-savvy users excited by AR and users who are primarily focused on the accessibility and utility of the captions.

## 3. User Stories & Requirements

| Priority | User Story                                                                                             | Acceptance Criteria                                                                                                                                                              |
| :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **P0**   | As a new user, I want a simple and clear onboarding process so I can understand how the app works and grant the necessary permissions (camera, microphone). | - A brief, skippable onboarding flow is presented on first launch. <br> - The flow clearly explains the app's value and why permissions are needed. <br> - Permission prompts are triggered at the appropriate time. |
| **P0**   | As a user, I want to easily switch between the 2D HUD mode and the 3D AR mode.                           | - A clear, accessible control (e.g., a toggle button) is always visible on the main screen. <br> - The transition between modes is smooth and fast. |
| **P1**   | As a user, I want the on-screen controls to be minimal and unobtrusive, so they don't distract from the main captioning experience. | - The UI is designed with a "less is more" philosophy. <br> - Controls fade out when not in use or are placed in non-critical areas of the screen. |
| **P2**   | As a user, I might want to adjust basic settings, like the caption display duration.                      | - A simple settings screen is accessible from the main UI. <br> - The user can adjust key parameters that affect their experience. |

## 4. Scope & Features

*   **In-Scope Features (Must-Haves):**
    *   High-fidelity mockups and prototypes for all app screens (e.g., using Figma or Sketch).
    *   A complete design system, including color palette, typography, iconography, and component styles.
    *   The visual design of the 2D and 3D caption bubbles.
    *   Design for the onboarding flow.
    *   Design for the main UI, including the mode-switching controls and settings access.
*   **Out-of-Scope Features (Won't Be Included in this Version):**
    *   Advanced user customization themes (e.g., light/dark mode, custom colors).
    *   A companion Apple Watch app.

## 5. Design & User Experience (UX)

*   **Key UX Principles:**
    *   **Clarity First:** The primary function is captioning; the UI must never obscure or interfere with the readability of the captions.
    *   **Intuitive:** Controls should be self-explanatory. Users should not need a manual to understand the app.
    *   **Accessible:** The design must be usable by people with a wide range of abilities, adhering to accessibility guidelines for contrast, touch target size, etc.
    *   **Aesthetically Pleasing:** The UI should be modern, clean, and visually polished to create a high-quality feel.

## 6. Technical Requirements & Constraints

*   **Platform(s):** iOS
*   **Technology Stack:** The design must be implementable using standard iOS UI frameworks (SwiftUI or UIKit).
*   **Performance Requirements:**
    *   The UI must be highly performant and never cause frame drops or stutters.

---

## 7. Analytics & Success Metrics

*   **How will we measure success?**
    *   Success will be measured through usability testing, user feedback, and app store ratings.
*   **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
    *   **Task Completion Rate:** Percentage of users who successfully complete key tasks (e.g., starting captioning, switching modes) in usability tests.
    *   **Time to First Caption:** The time it takes a new user to get from app launch to seeing their first live caption.
    *   **App Store Rating:** The average user rating in the Apple App Store.

---

## 8. Go-to-Market & Launch Plan

*   The final UI/UX design will be the basis for all marketing materials, screenshots, and promotional videos.

---

## 9. Open Questions & Assumptions

*   **Open Questions:**
    *   What is the most intuitive icon or control for switching between 2D and 3D modes? This should be explored through A/B testing or user feedback.
*   **Assumptions:**
    *   We assume users are familiar with standard iOS gestures and UI patterns.
    *   We assume a minimal, clean aesthetic is the best approach for this utility-focused application.

## Implementation Approach Update (2024)

**UX/UI design will be informed by the capabilities of a native plugin/FFI approach interfacing directly with the Gemma 3n model and its .task file.**
- No third-party Dart/Flutter packages will be used for inference.
- All context and inference will be handled natively (C/C++/Rust or platform-specific code).
- This enables full access to Gemma 3n's multimodal and context-aware capabilities.
- The Flutter app will communicate with the native layer via FFI or platform channels.
