## 1. Overview & Background

*   **What is this feature?**
    *   This encompasses the complete user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) design for the LiveCaptionsXR application, including the new AR captioning pipeline. It covers onboarding, in-app controls for switching modes, visual feedback for AR anchor placement, and the design of spatial (3D) caption bubbles that follow the speaker in real time using hybrid localization (audio, vision, IMU fusion).
*   **Why are we building this?**
    *   Powerful technology is only useful if it's presented through a clear, intuitive, and accessible interface. The new AR features require spatially-aware UI elements and feedback to help users understand where captions are anchored in the real world. The design must support both accessibility and spatial awareness.
*   **Business Objectives & Key Results (OKRs):**
    *   **Objective:** Create an intuitive, engaging, and spatially-aware user experience for AR captioning.
        *   **Key Result 1:** New users can successfully start using the app's core AR captioning feature within 30 seconds of first launch.
        *   **Key Result 2:** The app achieves a user satisfaction score of 4.5/5 or higher in app store ratings.
        *   **Key Result 3:** The final UI is compliant with WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards and provides clear spatial feedback for AR captions, including visual feedback for anchor placement.

## 3. User Stories & Requirements

| Priority | User Story                                                                                             | Acceptance Criteria                                                                                                                                                              |
| :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **P0**   | As a new user, I want a simple onboarding process so I can understand how AR captioning works and grant permissions (camera, microphone, motion). | - A brief, skippable onboarding flow is presented on first launch. <br> - The flow explains AR captioning, spatial anchoring, and why permissions are needed. <br> - Permission prompts are triggered at the appropriate time. |
| **P0**   | As a user, I want to easily switch between 2D HUD mode and 3D AR mode.                           | - A clear, accessible control (e.g., a toggle button) is always visible on the main screen. <br> - The transition between modes is smooth and fast. |
| **P0**   | As a user, I want to see captions anchored at the correct 3D position of the speaker in AR, following them as they move. | - Captions are spatially anchored using hybrid localization (audio, vision, IMU). <br> - Caption bubbles follow the speaker in real time. <br> - Visual feedback (e.g., animation or highlight) is provided for AR anchor placement and updates. |
| **P1**   | As a user, I want the on-screen controls to be minimal and unobtrusive, so they don't distract from the AR experience. | - The UI is designed with a "less is more" philosophy. <br> - Controls fade out when not in use or are placed in non-critical areas of the screen. |
| **P2**   | As a user, I might want to adjust basic settings, like caption display duration or AR anchor feedback.                      | - A simple settings screen is accessible from the main UI. <br> - The user can adjust key parameters that affect their AR experience, including spatial feedback options. |

## 5. Design & User Experience (UX)

*   **Key UX Principles:**
    *   **Clarity First:** The primary function is AR captioning; the UI must never obscure or interfere with the readability or spatial accuracy of captions.
    *   **Intuitive:** Controls should be self-explanatory. Users should not need a manual to understand the app.
    *   **Accessible & Spatially Aware:** The design must be usable by people with a wide range of abilities, adhering to accessibility guidelines for contrast, touch target size, and spatial feedback (e.g., clear AR anchor indicators, visual feedback for anchor placement). Spatial feedback is considered a core part of accessibility.
    *   **Aesthetically Pleasing:** The UI should be modern, clean, and visually polished to create a high-quality feel.

---

## 6. Technical Requirements & Constraints

*   **Platform(s):** iOS (ARKit, SwiftUI/UIKit) and Android (ARCore, Jetpack Compose/View)
*   **Technology Stack:** The design must be implementable using standard iOS and Android UI frameworks, with Flutter as the cross-platform layer.
*   **Integration:** The UI must support communication with native AR and localization plugins via MethodChannels or FFI. AR navigation and caption placement are handled through these channels, and the UI must provide real-time visual feedback for these actions (e.g., anchor placement, updates, and errors).
*   **Performance Requirements:**
    *   The UI must be highly performant and never cause frame drops or stutters, even during real-time AR captioning.

---

## 7. Analytics & Success Metrics

*   **How will we measure success?**
    *   Success will be measured through usability testing, user feedback, and app store ratings.
*   **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
    *   **Task Completion Rate:** Percentage of users who successfully complete key tasks (e.g., starting AR captioning, switching modes, seeing spatial captions, and recognizing anchor feedback) in usability tests.
    *   **Time to First AR Caption:** The time it takes a new user to get from app launch to seeing their first spatially-anchored caption.
    *   **App Store Rating:** The average user rating in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.

---

## 8. Go-to-Market & Launch Plan

*   The final UI/UX design will be the basis for all marketing materials, screenshots, and promotional videos, with a focus on spatial AR captioning and visual feedback for anchor placement.

---

## 9. Open Questions & Assumptions

*   **Open Questions:**
    *   What is the most intuitive icon or control for switching between 2D and 3D AR modes? This should be explored through A/B testing or user feedback.
    *   What is the best way to visually indicate the current AR anchor or fused speaker position (e.g., animation, highlight, or persistent marker)?
*   **Assumptions:**
    *   We assume users are familiar with standard iOS/Android gestures and UI patterns.
    *   We assume a minimal, clean aesthetic is the best approach for this utility-focused, spatially-aware application.
    *   We assume that spatial feedback (e.g., anchor highlights, animations) is essential for accessibility and user confidence in AR captioning.

## Implementation Approach Update (2025)

**UX/UI design is informed by the capabilities of a native plugin/FFI approach interfacing directly with the Gemma 3n model and its .task file, as well as ARKit/ARCore for spatial anchor management.**
- No third-party Dart/Flutter packages will be used for inference or AR; all context and inference will be handled natively (C/C++/Rust or platform-specific code).
- The Flutter app will communicate with the native layer via FFI or platform channels (MethodChannels).
- AR navigation and caption placement are handled through these channels, and the UI must provide real-time visual feedback for anchor placement, updates, and errors.
- The UI must provide real-time feedback for AR anchor placement and spatial caption rendering, leveraging fused localization (audio, vision, IMU), and ensure that spatial feedback is accessible and clear to all users.
