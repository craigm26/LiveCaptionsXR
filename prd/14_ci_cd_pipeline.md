## 1. Overview & Background

*   **What is this feature?**
    *   This task involves setting up an automated build, test, and deployment pipeline for both the Gemma 3n inference package and the main LiveCaptionsXR application. This will use a CI/CD service like GitHub Actions to automate the development workflow.
*   **Why are we building this?**
    *   Automation is key to maintaining high code quality, ensuring reliability, and streamlining the release process. A CI/CD pipeline will automatically run tests on every code change, preventing regressions. It will also automate the tedious and error-prone process of building and deploying the app to services like TestFlight and the App Store.
*   **Business Objectives & Key Results (OKRs):**
    *   **Objective:** Increase development velocity and improve code quality through automation.
        *   **Key Result 1:** All new pull requests are automatically built and tested, with the results reported back to the PR.
        *   **Key Result 2:** The time required to deploy a new build to TestFlight is reduced from a manual process (e.g., >1 hour) to an automated one (e.g., < 20 minutes).
        *   **Key Result 3:** The number of bugs that make it into the main branch is reduced by 50% due to automated testing.

## 2. Target Audience & User Personas

*   **Who is this for?**
    *   This is for the development team. It improves their workflow, allowing them to focus on building features rather than on manual testing and deployment tasks.

## 3. User Stories & Requirements

| Priority | User Story                                                                                             | Acceptance Criteria                                                                                                                                                              |
| :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **P0**   | As a developer, I want my code changes to be automatically tested before they are merged, so I can be confident I haven't broken anything. | - A CI workflow is triggered on every push to a pull request. <br> - The workflow runs all unit and integration tests. <br> - The workflow fails if any tests fail, blocking the merge. |
| **P0**   | As a developer, I want to be able to automatically deploy a new build to TestFlight by simply merging to the main branch or tagging a release. | - A CD workflow is triggered on a push to the `main` or `release` branch. <br> - The workflow archives the app, signs it with the correct provisioning profile, and uploads it to App Store Connect for TestFlight distribution. |
| **P1**   | As a developer, I want the CI pipeline to also run static analysis and linting, so we can maintain a consistent code style. | - The CI workflow includes a step to run a linter (e.g., SwiftLint). <br> - The build fails if there are linting errors. |

## 4. Scope & Features

*   **In-Scope Features (Must-Haves):**
    *   A CI workflow (e.g., a GitHub Actions `.yml` file).
    *   A job to build the Flutter package and the iOS app.
    *   A job to run unit tests.
    *   A deployment job that handles code signing and uploads to TestFlight.
    *   Secure management of secrets (e.g., App Store Connect API keys, code signing certificates) using GitHub Secrets.
*   **Out-of-Scope Features (Won't Be Included in this Version):**
    *   Automated UI testing (this is a more complex task for a later stage).
    *   Automated deployment directly to the public App Store (this should still be a manual step for now).
    *   CI/CD for the Android version of the app (this PRD focuses on the iOS pipeline).

## 5. Design & User Experience (UX)

*   This is a purely technical task with no direct UI/UX, but it directly impacts the quality and reliability of the final user-facing product.

---

## 6. Technical Requirements & Constraints

*   **Platform(s):** macOS (for the CI runners).
*   **Technology Stack:** GitHub Actions, Fastlane (to simplify iOS build and deployment automation), YAML.
*   **Dependencies:**
    *   Requires an Apple Developer account and an App Store Connect API key.

---

## 7. Analytics & Success Metrics

*   **How will we measure success?**
    *   Success will be measured by the reliability of the pipeline and the time saved in the development process.
*   **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
    *   **CI Build Time:** The average time it takes for the CI workflow to complete.
    *   **Deployment Frequency:** How often new builds are successfully deployed to TestFlight.
    *   **Pipeline Success Rate:** The percentage of pipeline runs that complete successfully (excluding genuine test failures).

---

## 8. Go-to-Market & Launch Plan

*   This is an internal process improvement and has no external launch plan.

---

## 9. Open Questions & Assumptions

*   **Open Questions:**
    *   What is the most secure and efficient way to handle iOS code signing in a CI environment? (e.g., using Fastlane Match or manual certificate installation).
*   **Assumptions:**
    *   We assume that GitHub Actions provides macOS runners that are suitable for building and testing our iOS application.
    *   We assume that all necessary testing can be automated and run in a headless CI environment.
