# live_captions_xr: Technical Writeup for Google Gemma 3n Hackathon

**Real-time closed captioning for Android XR headsets powered by on-device multimodal AI**

---

## Executive Summary

live_captions_xr represents a pioneering application of Google's Gemma 3n multimodal AI model to solve a critical accessibility challenge: providing real-time, spatially-aware closed captioning for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing (D/HH) community in Android XR environments. By leveraging Gemma 3n's unique ability to process audio, visual, and textual inputs simultaneously, we've created an on-device XR solution that transforms traditional flat captioning into immersive, contextual communication aids.

**Key Innovation**: Rather than simply transcribing speech, live_captions_xr provides spatial captioning with contextual understanding by fusing multimodal data streams through Gemma 3n's unified intelligence, answering not just "what was said" but "who said it," "where are they," and "what's the context of this conversation?"

## Gemma 3n Integration: Technical Deep Dive

### Why Gemma 3n is Revolutionary for This Use Case

Traditional accessibility solutions process audio and visual data in isolation, requiring complex post-processing to correlate information. Gemma 3n's **unified multimodal architecture** changes this paradigm by processing all sensory inputs within a single model context.

#### Multimodal Fusion Workflow

1. **Audio Stream Processing**
   - Continuous audio capture from device microphone array
   - Real-time sound event detection using Gemma 3n's Universal Speech Model (USM) encoder
   - Sound localization via Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) calculation

2. **Visual Context Acquisition**
   - Camera feed analysis using Gemma 3n's MobileNet-V5 vision encoder
   - Object detection and scene understanding
   - Spatial relationship mapping between detected objects and localized sounds

3. **Contextual Intelligence**
   - Gemma 3n processes audio, visual, and contextual inputs simultaneously
   - Generates natural language descriptions with spatial and temporal context
   - Provides actionable insights based on user's current situation

#### Example Implementation

```dart
// Core multimodal inference pipeline
class Gemma3nService {
  Future<String> processMultimodalInput({
    required Float32List audioBuffer,
    required Uint8List imageFrame,
    required String userContext,
  }) async {
    
    // Prepare inputs for Gemma 3n
    final inputs = {
      'audio': preprocessAudio(audioBuffer),
      'image': preprocessImage(imageFrame), 
      'text': tokenizeContext(userContext),
    };
    
    // Run unified inference
    final output = await _interpreter.runForMultipleInputs(inputs, outputMap);
    
    // Decode multimodal response
    return decodeResponse(output);
  }
}
```

### Technical Challenges and Solutions

#### Challenge 1: Model Deployment and Mobile Integration

**Solution**: Google's pre-trained Gemma 3n LiteRT models provide optimized mobile deployment.

**Implementation**: 
- **Pre-trained LiteRT Models**: Direct integration of Google-optimized .tflite models
- **No Conversion Required**: Eliminates hardware constraints and custom optimization
- **Production Ready**: Google-optimized quantization and mobile performance
- **Modular Architecture**: Unified multimodal model with component fallbacks

```dart
// Direct LiteRT model loading
_interpreter = await Interpreter.fromAsset('assets/models/gemma3n_multimodal.task');

// Configure for optimal mobile performance
_interpreter.useNNAPI = true;  // Android acceleration
_interpreter.useGpuDelegate = true;  // GPU optimization
_interpreter.setNumThreads(2);  // Battery vs performance balance
```

#### Challenge 2: Real-time Processing Requirements

**Problem**: D/HH users require immediate awareness of environmental changes, demanding sub-second response times.

**Solution**:
- **Streaming Inference**: Continuous processing of audio/visual streams rather than batch processing
- **Optimized Preprocessing**: Hardware-accelerated audio/image preprocessing pipelines
- **Predictive Caching**: Pre-computing likely responses for common scenarios

#### Challenge 3: Privacy and On-device Requirements

**Problem**: Sensitive audio and visual data cannot be transmitted to cloud services.

**Solution**: 
- **Full On-device Processing**: Complete inference pipeline runs locally using TensorFlow Lite
- **No Network Dependencies**: Application functions completely offline
- **Data Encryption**: Temporary data encrypted in memory during processing

## Implementation Architecture

### Service Layer Design

The application follows a **clean architecture pattern** with clear separation between data acquisition, AI processing, and user interface:

```dart
// Core service orchestration
class live_captions_xrEngine {
  final AudioService _audioService;
  final CameraService _cameraService;
  final Gemma3nService _aiService;
  final LocalizationService _localizationService;
  
  Stream<EnvironmentalUpdate> get updates => _combineStreams();
  
  Stream<EnvironmentalUpdate> _combineStreams() async* {
    await for (final audioEvent in _audioService.soundStream) {
      final visualContext = await _cameraService.getCurrentFrame();
      final userLocation = await _localizationService.getContext();
      
      final insight = await _aiService.processMultimodalInput(
        audioBuffer: audioEvent.buffer,
        imageFrame: visualContext,
        userContext: userLocation.toString(),
      );
      
      yield EnvironmentalUpdate(
        description: insight,
        location: audioEvent.sourceDirection,
        confidence: audioEvent.confidence,
        timestamp: DateTime.now(),
      );
    }
  }
}
```

### Data Flow Architecture

1. **Sensor Layer**: Continuous data acquisition from microphone array and camera
2. **Processing Layer**: Real-time audio localization and visual preprocessing  
3. **AI Layer**: Gemma 3n multimodal inference and contextual understanding
4. **Accessibility Layer**: Multi-channel feedback delivery (visual, haptic, LED)

  static const Map<SoundType, List<int>> _patterns = {
    SoundType.emergency: [100, 50, 100, 50, 200], // Urgent pattern
    SoundType.doorbell: [150, 100, 150],           // Rhythmic pattern  
    SoundType.vehicle: [200, 100, 100, 100],       // Progressive pattern
  };
  
  Future<void> provideFeedback(SoundEvent event) async {
    final pattern = _patterns[event.type] ?? [100];
    await HapticFeedback.heavyImpact();
    // Implementation continues...
  }
}
```
