# live_captions_xr - Project Plan

**This document tracks the development status and milestones for live_captions_xr, guided by the detailed PRDs in the `/prd` directory.**

---

## Development Process

This project follows a **PRD-driven development** methodology. The entire scope of the project has been broken down into 14 distinct, manageable tasks. Each task has a corresponding Product Requirements Document (PRD) in the `/prd` directory.

**All development work must align with the specifications outlined in these PRDs.** They are the single source of truth for features, architecture, and acceptance criteria.

---

## Current Development Status (as of June 2025)

The project is currently in the **initial implementation phase**. The foundational architecture has been defined, and the development tasks have been clearly specified in the PRDs.

### âœ… Completed
-   **Architecture Definition:** The layered, MediaPipe-based architecture is documented in `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
-   **PRD Creation:** All 14 core tasks have a detailed PRD.
-   **Project Scaffolding:** The initial Flutter project is set up.

### ðŸ”„ In Progress
-   Implementation of the tasks as defined in the `/prd` directory, starting with the foundational layers (Audio Capture, Basic Localization, etc.).

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

| Risk                               | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------- | ------ | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| MediaPipe API limitations          | High   | Medium      | The architecture is modular, allowing for alternative inference engines if necessary. Stay updated on MediaPipe releases. |
| Performance on lower-end devices   | Medium | High        | Implement adaptive quality settings and prioritize optimizations as per PRD #13.                                |
| Accuracy of localization algorithms | Medium | Medium      | The hybrid fusion strategy (PRD #11) is designed to mitigate the weaknesses of individual algorithms.           |
